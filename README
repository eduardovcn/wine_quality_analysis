This repository is about a challenge offer by AdaTech.

I received the data frame wine_quality.csv and had the following objectives:

1. Extract all the present data

2. Identify which wines were the best and what they had in common

3. Find the variables that could be correlated with wine quality

4. Categorize wine quality in the best possible way, to identify which wines were good and which were bad

5. Statistically validate the possible correlated variables
